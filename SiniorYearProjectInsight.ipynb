    "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranked as a worldwide leading fatal illness. Cancer develops primarily from the cells that line both milk ducts and lobules that perform milk production and transportation functions. The majority of breast cancer cases occur in female patients but it does develop in males. \n",

    "Medical statistics indicate that women make up the majority of breast cancer patients in the United States where 310,720 new cases are predicted for 2024. Statistics show that breast cancer will affect 2,790 male patients during this period. Breast cancer affects men in 0.9% of total breast cancer cases while women stand at 99.1% of the total cases. The illness initially stays contained in breast tissue yet advances to penetrate neighboring tissues prior to reaching lymph nodes and distant parts of the body through bloodstream or lymphatic systems. The correct early discovery and group assignment of breast cancer remains essential because different breast cancer subtypes demand particular treatment methodologies which enhance survival outcomes.\n"

    "## Goal:\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to use Hidden Markov model for cancer classification using gene expression profiles. The model is designed to classify different types of cancer by modeling the gene expression of each tumor type with an HMM. \n",
    "We are classifying cancer using gene expression profiles by integrating gene ranking methods with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The method focuses on selecting the most informative genes such as including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test and signal to noise ratio.\n",
    "## <span style=\"color: green\">Broader impact</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cancer Subtype Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "* HMMs can help differentiate between cancer subtypes by modeling gene expression patterns.\n",
    "* We can discover hidden states that correspond to different cancer progression stages or molecular subtypes.\n",
    "2. Identification of Biomarkers for Cancer Progression\n",
    "* By analyzing state transitions, you can identify genes that play a crucial role in cancer progression.\n",
    "* Genes consistently associated with high-expression hidden states can be potential biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis.\n",
    "3. Gene Regulatory Network Inference\n",
    "* HMMs can reveal gene co-expression patterns and identify groups of genes that are regulated together.\n",
    "* This insight helps in understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of cancer development.\n",
    "4. Detection of Aberrant Gene Expression States\n",
    "* Some genes may transition between normal and cancerous expression states.\n",
    "* Tracking these transitions can help identify early warning signs of cancer or predict relapse risk.\n",
    "5. Evolutionary Insights into Cancer Development\n",
    "* HMMs can model cancer as a sequential process, showing how gene expression evolves over time.\n",
    "* This can help predict tumor progression, drug resistance, or metastatic potential.\n",
    "6. Personalized Treatment and Therapy Response Prediction\n",

    "2. Protein-Based Methods\n",
    "mRNA levels do not always correlate directly with protein levels, so these methods measure protein abundance.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Western Blot\n",
    "Uses antibodies to detect specific proteins in a sample.\n",
    "Advantages: Specific, qualitative/semi-quantitative.\n",
    "Disadvantages: Low-throughput, only detects known proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\n",
    "Uses antibodies to quantify proteins in a liquid sample.\n",
    "Advantages: Highly sensitive and specific.\n",
    "Disadvantages: Limited to known proteins, cannot detect post-translational modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics\n",
    "Identifies and quantifies proteins in a sample using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\n",
    "Advantages: High-throughput, detects post-translational modifications.\n",
    "Disadvantages: Requires expertise, expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional Methods\n",
    "Instead of measuring mRNA or protein abundance, these methods assess gene expression by measuring biological activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Reporter Gene Assays\n",
    "Inserts a reporter gene (e.g., GFP, Luciferase) under a promoter of interest.\n",

    "Advantages: Provides direct evidence of translation.\n",
    "Disadvantages: Technically complex, requires deep sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Gene Expression Important in Cancer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cancer occurs when specific genes (oncogenes) become overactive or when tumor suppressor genes stop functioning properly. Identifying which genes behave abnormally in cancer cells allows researchers to classify cancer types and potentially guide treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gene Selection: Choosing the Most Important Genes\n",
    "**Problem: Too Many Genes, Not All Relevant**\n",
    "* A DNA microarray (gene chip) can measure the expression levels of thousands of genes at once, but not all of them are useful for classification.\n",
    "* If we include all genes, the model becomes too complex and inefficient.\n",
    "* The goal is to filter out irrelevant genes and identify the most informative ones.\n",
    "Solution: Gene Selection Methods\n",
    "* The article introduces several ranking techniques to select key genes that differentiate between cancerous and normal tissues. These techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**t-test:** Finds genes that show significant differences in expression levels between cancerous and normal cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entropy test:** – Measures disorder in gene expression; genes with high entropy provide better class separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:** Selects genes with strong discriminatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wilcoxon test:** A non-parametric test that ranks genes based on their median expression difference.\n",
    "**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** Compares differences in mean expression levels with the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modified Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for Gene Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional AHP is a decision-making method used for prioritizing factors based on expert judgment.\n",
    "The authors modified AHP to integrate the rankings from the above five methods automatically.\n",
    "Instead of relying on human experts, this method uses statistical rankings to create a robust and stable set of key genes for classification.\n",
    "3. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for Cancer Classification\n",
    "Why HMMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cancer develops in stages, similar to how states change in an HMM.\n",
    "HMMs are great for analyzing sequential patterns and capturing the transitions between different gene expression states.\n",
    "How HMMs Work in Cancer Classification\n",
    "Each cancer type gets its own HMM model.\n",
    "* If we are classifying between normal and cancerous tissues, we train two separate HMMs:\n",
    "    * One for normal gene expression patterns.\n",
    "    * One for cancer gene expression patterns.\n",
    "### Training the HMM\n",
    "The selected genes from the AHP method serve as input features.\n",
    "The model learns probability distributions for these genes from labeled training data.\n",
    "Classifying a New Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new patient’s gene expression data is inputted, it is tested against both trained HMMs.\n",
    "The HMM with the higher probability of generating the observed gene expression determines the classification (cancer or normal).\n",

    "Steps/Process of Illumina Sequencing\n",
    "1. Nucleic Acid Extraction\n",
    "The first step in Illumina sequencing is isolating the genetic material from samples of interest. The extraction process is important because the quality of the nucleic acids extracted will directly affect the sequencing results. After extraction, a quality control check is usually performed to ensure the nucleic acids are pure and accurately quantified. UV spectrophotometry is typically used to check the purity, while fluorometric methods are preferred for measuring nucleic acid concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Library Preparation\n",
    "After nucleic acids are isolated, they are prepared for sequencing by creating a library which is a collection of adapter-ligated DNA fragments that can be read by the sequencer. The process starts with DNA fragmentation, where the sample is broken into smaller fragments using methods like mechanical shearing, enzymatic digestion, or transposon-based fragmentation. These fragments undergo end repair and A-tailing to prepare for the attachment of short specific DNA sequences called adapters to both ends of the fragments. These adapters contain sequences that help bind the DNA to the sequencing flow cell. They also include barcode sequences that allow multiple samples to be sequenced simultaneously and distinguished later in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cluster Generation by Bridge Amplification\n",
    "The DNA library is loaded onto a flow cell containing small lanes where amplification and sequencing occurs. The DNA fragments bind to complementary primers attached to the solid surface of the flow cell and undergo bridge amplification. In bridge PCR, each DNA strand bends over to form a bridge on a chip. Forward and reverse primers on the chip help the DNA form these bridges. Each bridge is amplified, creating many clusters at each spot. The process of cluster generation finishes when each DNA spot on the chip has enough copies to produce a strong, clear signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)\n",
    "Once clusters are generated, the SBS process begins. Fluorescently labeled nucleotides are added one by one to the growing DNA strand and each nucleotide emits a fluorescence as it attaches. The specific color emitted allows the system to identify the nucleotide. The sequence of each DNA fragment is determined over multiple cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Analysis\n",
    "Once the sequencing is completed, the sequences obtained are processed and analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Images collected from each cycle are converted into base sequences by analyzing the fluorescent signals. Bioinformatics tools clean up and organize the data, ensuring the sequences are ready for analysis. Then, the data are analyzed, aligning the sequences to a reference genome or assembling them if a reference is unavailable. This process helps identify sequence variants, map gene locations, and allow downstream analyses. Finally, the data is interpreted to analyze pathways, identify potential biomarkers, or predict gene functions. This step helps translate raw sequencing data into meaningful biological insights. Some Illumina instruments have built-in, easy-to-use analysis software that can help researchers without bioinformatics expertise.\n",

Pharmacological inhibitors targeting CDK4/6 have demonstrated significant activity against various tumor types such as breast cancer.

Using Conditional medium co-culture, quantitative high-throughput combinational screen (qHTCS), and genomic sequencing, we report that the RUNX1-PDGFBB-AKt pathway was significantly elevated in palbociclib-resistance cells. Inhibition of this axis can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Palbociclib and surmount Palbociclib resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modifies RUNX1 with O-GlcNAcylation at Serine 252 (Ser252), thereby stabilizing RUNX1 protein expression, which is crucial in regulating PDGFBB expression. Significantly, clinical studies also confirm that RUNX1-PDGFBB-Akt pahtway was elevated in palbociclib-resistance patients.

'Background: Breast cancer (BCa) is a heterogeneous disease requiring precise diagnostics to guide effective treatment. Current assays fail to adequately address the complex biology of BCa subtypes/risk groups and accurately predict responses to treatments like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). To address these limitations, we developed and validated a novel diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tool, mFISHseq. Methods: Our approach, mFISHseq, integrates multiplexed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization with RNA-sequencing, guided by laser capture microdissection. This technique ensures tumor purity, allows unbiased profiling of whole transcriptome data, and explicitly quantifies intratumoral heterogeneity. Results: In a retrospective cohort study involving 1,082 FFPE breast tumors, mFISHseq demonstrated high analytical validity with 93% accuracy compared to immunohistochemistry across training and test sets. Our consensus subtyping approach provided near-perfect concordance with other molecular classifiers (κ > 0.85) and reclassified 30% of samples into subtypes with distinct prognostic implications. Consensus risk groups mitigated misclassification of single samples and provided prognostic information about both early and late relapse. High risk patients had enriched innate and adaptive immune signatures, which predicted response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified patients responsive to ADCs, as evidenced by a 19-feature classifier for T-DM1 sensitivity, validated on the multicenter, phase II, prospective I-SPY2 trial. To demonstrate the clinical potential, we deployed mFISHseq as a research use only test on 48 patients, revealing insights into the efficacy of novel targeted therapies, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and ADCs. Conclusion: The mFISHseq method solves a long-standing challenge in the precise diagnosis and classification of BCa subtypes/prognostic risk groups, and allows accurate response prediction for patients, including those treated with immunotherapies and ADCs.', 'GPL': '24676', 'GSE': '283522', 'taxon': 'Homo sapiens', 'entryType': 'GSE', 'gdsType': 'Expression profiling by high throughput

HER2 status, ER expression levels and global DNA methylation was assessed in pre-treatment biopsies, in post-treatment samples in patients with residual disease and, where relevant, in metastatic tumour samples. Mapping of the methylation landscape revealed global gains in hypomethylation following treatment (n=7 matched tumours, 16 samples) in contrast to hypermethylation on metastasis (n=5 matched tumours, 14 samples). Differential methylation of key signalling pathways, including estrogen response, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, is conserved between post-treatment and metastasis.

Its best characterized function is the inhibition of RAS signaling through its GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) domain. Additional functions have been proposed but not deeply investigated, due to its large size and complex domain structure. Here, combining patient data, in vitro/in vivo models and protein biochemistry, we show that NF1 is a novel Microtubule-Associated Protein (MAP) that modulates microtubular dynamics and intra-tubular repair. NF1 loss results in mitotic defects such as prolonged mitosis, supranumerary centrosomes and chromosome missegregation, leading to low-grade aneuploidy in cell lines and patients. Loss of NF1-mediated intratubular repair creates a liability specifically targetable by maytansinoids, a class of microtubule-depolymerizing agents widely used as payloads in Antibody-Drug Conjugates such as Trastuzumab-Emtansine (T-DM1).

Nonetheless, the scarcity of tumor-specific antigens and the limited capacity of T cells to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment significantly limit its clinical use in solid tumors. Here, we provide evidence of FcγRI expressing CD8+ T cells presence in both mouse and human tumors as well as inflammation sites. Inspired by this discovery, we engineered a novel FcγRI-based receptor for T cells. This design allows T cells to target tumor cells indirectly through antibody intermediates, separating the processes of antigen recognition and T cell activation. This approach allows T cells to initiate killing exclusively against cells with antigen overexpression, thus minimizing on-target off-tumor cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the modified FcγRI expression in T cells unexpectedly induces constitutive expression of the CD11b integrin. This additional effect enables the engineered T cells to efficiently infiltrate the tumor basement membrane and develop an effector memory phenotype, potentially promoting long-term anti-tumor activity. The presence of these effector memory subsets characterized complete responders and mediated tumor regression upon rechallenge. Overall, T cell-mediated ADCC suggests an alternative, novel strategy for conventional CAR-T cell design, enables T cells to differentiate between target cells expressing the same antigen, and overcomes the physical barriers of the tumor microenvironment.', 'GPL': '18573', 'GSE': '263177', 'taxon': 'Homo sapiens', 'entryType': 'GSE', 'gdsType': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', 'ptechType': '', 'valType': '', 'SSInfo': '', 'subsetInfo': '', 'PDAT': '2024/12/01', 'suppFile': 'CSV, XLSX', 'Samples': [{'Accession': 'GSM8187199', 'Title': 'Not activated CAR Her2 transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187193', 'Title': 'Sub-optimally activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187196', 'Title': 'Optimally activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187182', 'Title': 'Not activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187202', 'Title': 'Optimally activated CAR Her2 transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187185', 'Title': 'Sub-optimally activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187191', 'Title': 'Not activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187194', 'Title': 'Sub-optimally activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187188', 'Title': 'Optimally activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187200', 'Title': 'Not activated CAR Her2 transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187197', 'Title': 'Optimally activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187180', 'Title': 'Not activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187183', 'Title': 'Sub-optimally activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187203', 'Title': 'Optimally activated CAR Her2 transduced T cells bio rep 3'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187186', 'Title': 'Optimally activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187192', 'Title': 'Sub-optimally activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187195', 'Title': 'Optimally activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187201', 'Title': 'Optimally activated CAR Her2 transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187181', 'Title': 'Not activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187189', 'Title': 'Not activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187190', 'Title': 'Not activated Sham transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187198', 'Title': 'Not activated CAR Her2 transduced T cells bio rep 1'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187184', 'Title': 'Sub-optimally activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 2'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8187187', 'Title': 'Optimally activated AG2G transduced T cells bio rep 2'}], 'Relations': [], 'ExtRelations': [], 'n_samples': IntegerElement(24, attributes={}), 'SeriesTitle': '', 'PlatformTitle': '', 'PlatformTaxa': '', 'SamplesTaxa': '', 'PubMedIds': [], 'Projects': [], 'FTPLink': 'ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE263nnn/GSE263177/', 'GEO2R': 'no'}], [{'Item': [], 'Id': '200248460', 'Accession': 'GSE248460', 'GDS': '', 'title': 'The micro RNA expression of 5 nomal breast tissues and 15 breast cancer tissues', 'summary': 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate the function of target genes at the post-transcriptional phase.

FOXA1 is also expressed in human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/ErbB2) positive breast cancers, but its functions in HER2 positive breast cancer are unclear. The loss of FOXA1 results in a decrease in the viability of HER2 positive and HER2 amplified cell lines suggesting that FOXA1 may have an important role in HER2 positive breast cancers. In this report, we examined patient-derived single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data and demonstrated that FOXA1 is co-expressed with ErbB2 in HER2 positive breast cancers.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) identified FOXA1 binding motifs in the ErbB2 promoter and regulatory element regions, which controlled ErbB2 gene expression. Interestingly, the knockdown of FOXA1 increased Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) signaling and inhibited luminal tumor differentiation. Furthermore, FOXA1 and TRPS1 regulated TEAD/YAP-TAZ activity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that FOXA1 is required for HER2 expression and luminal identity in HER2+ breast cancer.', 'GPL': '21697', 'GSE': '267921', 'taxon': 'Homo sapiens', 'entryType': 'GSE', 'gdsType': 'Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing', 'ptechType': '', 'valType': '', 'SSInfo': '', 'subsetInfo': '', 'PDAT': '2024/09/01', 'suppFile': 'BW', 'Samples': [{'Accession': 'GSM8281632', 'Title': 'ATAC-seq_SKBR3_02'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8281633', 'Title': 'ATAC-seq_SKBR3_FOXA1KD_01'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8281631', 'Title': 'ATAC-seq_SKBR3_01'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8281634', 'Title': 'ATAC-seq_SKBR3_FOXA1KD_02'}], 'Relations': [], 'ExtRelations': [], 'n_samples': IntegerElement(4, attributes={}), 'SeriesTitle': '', 'PlatformTitle': '', 'PlatformTaxa': '', 'SamplesTaxa': '', 'PubMedIds': [], 'Projects': [], 'FTPLink': 'ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE267nnn/GSE267921/', 'GEO2R': 'no'}], [{'Item': [], 'Id': '200267920', 'Accession': 'GSE267920', 'GDS': '', 'title': 'FOXA1 is required for ErbB2 expression and luminal differentiation in HER2-positive breast cancer [RNA-seq]', 'summary': 'Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) has been shown to have critical functions in prostate and ER alpha positive breast cancer.

Pharmacological inhibitors targeting CDK4/6 have demonstrated significant activity against various tumor types such as breast cancer. However, resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) (such as palbociclib) remain an immense obstacle in clinical and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood. Using Conditional medium co-culture, quantitative high-throughput combinational screen (qHTCS), and genomic sequencing, we report that the RUNX1-PDGFBB-AKt pathway was significantly elevated in palbociclib-resistance cells. Inhibition of this axis can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of Palbociclib and surmount Palbociclib resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modifies RUNX1 with O-GlcNAcylation at Serine 252 (Ser252), thereby stabilizing RUNX1 protein expression, which is crucial in regulating PDGFBB expression. Significantly, clinical studies also confirm that RUNX1-PDGFBB-Akt pahtway was elevated in palbociclib-resistance patients. Collectively, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which RUNX1-PDGFBB mediated palbociclib resistance, and provide valuable insights for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies in future clinical contexts.', 'GPL': '20301', 'GSE': '264264', 'taxon': 'Homo sapiens', 'entryType': 'GSE', 'gdsType': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', 'ptechType': '', 'valType': '', 'SSInfo': '', 'subsetInfo': '', 'PDAT': '2025/01/30', 'suppFile': 'CSV, TXT', 'Samples': [{'Accession': 'GSM8215182', 'Title': 'MCF-7 PR-2 cells'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8215185', 'Title': 'MCF-7 PR si-PDGFB-2 cells'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8215186', 'Title': 'MCF-7 PR si-PDGFB-3 cells'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8215183', 'Title': 'MCF-7 PR-3 cells'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8215181', 'Title': 'MCF-7 PR-1 cells'}, {'Accession': 'GSM8215184', 'Title': 'MCF-7 PR si-PDGFB-1 cells'}], 'Relations': [], 'ExtRelations': [], 'n_samples': IntegerElement(6, attributes={}), 'SeriesTitle': '', 'PlatformTitle': '', 'PlatformTaxa': '', 'SamplesTaxa': '', 'PubMedIds': [], 'Projects': [], 'FTPLink': 'ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE264nnn/GSE264264/', 'GEO2R': 'no'}]"
