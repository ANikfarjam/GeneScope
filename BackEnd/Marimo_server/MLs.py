        GeneScop utilizes a deep learnign apprach to create a predictive model for breast cancer stages classification given gene expression and clinical variables. We had a huge data set of data consist of 2100 samples. Each sample is consist of clinical data such as Age, tumore related data(TNM), vital status and Gene expressions.


        ### <span style="color:brown">Intro to he Multimodal Deep Neural Network for Multi-dimensional Data </span>

        The Multimodal Deep Neural Network for Multi-dimensional Data (MDNNMD) is a neural architecture designed to integrate and learn from multiple heterogeneous data sources simultaneously. Instead of feeding all features into a single model, MDNNMD builds independent deep neural networks for each data modality‚Äîsuch as gene expression, clinical records, and genomic alterations‚Äîallowing each to learn specialized feature representations. These subnetworks are then combined using fusion, where the outputs of each modality-specific DNN are weighted and aggregated to produce a final prediction.

        ) pulished an article utilizing this modol on cancer prognosis study. They emphasize the modular and flexible architecture enables MDNNMD to capture complementary information across different data types, allows enrichment of features. Minority class samples may have weak signals in one modality (e.g., clinical), but strong signals in another (e.g., gene expressions). This helps the model see them better.

            <p>All raw features from each modality are concatenated before being input into a single model. This works well if modalities are aligned and comparable in scale, but may suffer from noise or high dimensionality.</p>

            <h4>Intermediate Fusion</h4>
            <p>Each modality is processed by its own neural network, and their intermediate feature representations are combined‚Äîusually through concatenation or attention‚Äîbefore passing through shared layers for prediction. This balances independence and interaction.</p>

            <h4>Late Fusion</h4>
            <p>Each modality has a fully independent network, and predictions from each are aggregated (e.g., averaged, weighted sum, or voted) at the decision level. This approach is modular and robust, ideal when modalities are heterogeneous or separately trained.</p>

        Before diving into model training, we started by preparing the clinical dataset. The target variable we wanted to predict was Stage, which refers to the stage of breast cancer for each patient. To get the data into a usable format, we encoded all categorical variables using LabelEncoder, since machine learning models generally require numerical inputs. We also filled in any missing values with the mean of each column ‚Äî not perfect, but a reasonable starting point for handling gaps in the data. When everything was cleaned up, we then split the dataset into training and test sets using an 80/20 split. This gave us a good balance between having enough data to train the model and enough to evaluate it afterward. With that done, we trained a baseline RandomForestClassifier using the default settings (100 trees, no max depth, etc.). This gave us a first look at how well the model could predict cancer stages using all the features and set the foundation for deeper analysis.

        The initial classification report looked promising. For example, classes like Stage IIA and Stage IIB were predicted quite well, while classes like Stage II and Stage IIIC showed lower performance, probably due to class imbalance or overlap in clinical features. This gave us a sense of which labels were harder for the model to get right and where there might be room to improve

        ### <span style="color: brown">Utilizing AHP</span>

        The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a structured decision-making approach that helps prioritize and select the most important criteria in complex problems. It works by breaking a problem into a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, assigning numerical values to their relative importance, and using pairwise comparisons to generate a weighted ranking. Traditional AHP is often qualitative, relying on expert judgment, but in bioinformatics, a modified AHP can integrate statistical methods to enhance objectivity.


        In the context of biomarker analysis for BRCA-related research, AHP can significantly improve the selection of key biomarkers by aggregating multiple statistical gene selection methods. Instead of relying on a single metric, such as a t-test or entropy, the modified AHP integrates multiple ranking criteria (e.g., Wilcoxon test, ROC curves, signal-to-noise ratio) to create a more stable and reliable subset of genes. This method ensures that the chosen biomarkers are not only statistically significant but also robust across different datasets and ranking approaches. By identifying the most influential genes systematically, AHP helps refine the list of biomarkers that could be further analyzed for their role in breast cancer progression, prognosis, or response to treatment.

        <span style="color: brown">Modified AHP:</span>

        * <span style="color: brown">Two-Sample t-Test:</span>

        Purpose: Identifies statistically significant differences in gene expression between two groups (e.g., cancerous vs. healthy cells).

        Method: Compares the means of two independent samples using the t-statistic.

        Output: A t-score and p-value. A small p-value indicates significant differences in expression.

        * <span style="color: brown">Entropy Test:</span>

        Purpose: Measures the disorder in gene expression levels.

        Method: Computes entropy using histogram-based probability distributions.

        Output: Higher entropy values indicate genes with more variability, which are more useful for classification.

        * <span style="color: brown">Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test:</span>

        Purpose: A non-parametric test used to rank genes based on their median expression differences.

        Method: Compares the ranks of two independent samples instead of their means.

        Output: A Wilcoxon statistic and a p-value. A low p-value suggests significant differences in gene ranks.

        * <span style="color: brown">Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):</span>

        Purpose: Compares the difference in mean expression levels relative to the standard deviation.

        Method: SNR is calculated as the difference between the means of two groups divided by the sum of their standard deviations.

        Output: A higher SNR suggests that the gene has a strong discriminatory power between groups.

        * <span style="color: brown">AHP Weighted Ranking:</span>

        Purpose: Integrates statistical measures into a single weighted ranking system to prioritize significant genes.

        Method: Normalizes scores across all statistical tests and applies predefined weights.

        Output: A final ranking score indicating the importance of each gene in classification.

        * <span style="color: brown"> Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Gene Selection (Modified AHP): </span>

        The modified Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) used for gene selection involves constructing a pairwise comparison matrix where genes are ranked based on multiple statistical criteria (e.g., t-test, entropy, ROC, Wilcoxon, and SNR).

        The matrix is required to be consistent, meaning that its elements must satisfy certain transitivity properties.
        Eigenvectors are computed from this matrix to obtain ranking scores of genes. These eigenvectors correspond to the principal components that define the most discriminative genes.

        The largest eigenvalue (ùúÜùëöùëéùë•) is used to compute the Consistency Index (CI) and Consistency Ratio (CR) to ensure that the ranking process is mathematically sound.
        Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in HMMs:

        HMMs use transition probability matrices to model state changes in gene expression related to cancer progression.
        The transition probability matrix (A) is a stochastic matrix that describes the likelihood of transitioning from one state to another.

        The stationary distribution of states (long-term probabilities of each state) is found by computing the dominant eigenvector (associated with eigenvalue 1) of this matrix.

        Spectral analysis (using eigenvalues) helps determine the stability and convergence properties of the HMM.
        Why This Matters for Cancer Classification

        Gene Selection (AHP with Eigenvectors) ensures that the most informative genes are chosen based on multiple criteria, improving classification accuracy.

        HMMs with Eigenvalues provide a probabilistic framework to model cancer progression and classify gene expression data efficiently.

        Eigenvectors define important features, helping reduce computational complexity and improving stability.

        The elements of the matrix are computed based on **quantitative criteria**, which include:
        - **t-test**
        - **Entropy**
        - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve**
        - **Wilcoxon test**
        - **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**

        The absolute difference between the statistical values of two genes $i$ and $j$ is used to compute the pairwise importance score:

        $$
        d_{ij} = |c_i - c_j|
        $$

        where $c_i$ and $c_j$ are the scores of genes $i$ and $j$ under the given criterion. The final matrix values are scaled within the range **[1,10]** using:

        $$
        c = \frac{d_{ij} - 9}{c_{\max}} + 1
        $$

        $$
        x_{ij} =
        \begin{cases} 
        c, & \text{if } c_i \geq c_j \\
        \frac{1}{c}, & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
        $$

        where $c_{\max}$ is the maximum distance between genes.

        ## **2. Eigenvector Calculation (Ranking Genes)**
        Once the pairwise comparison matrix is constructed, **eigenvectors** are used to determine the ranking of genes. The eigenvector $\lambda$ is computed using:

        $$
        S_j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij}
        $$

        $$
        \lambda_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{x_{ij}}{S_j}
        $$

        This **normalized eigenvector** represents the ranking of genes.

        ## **3. Eigenvalue Calculation and Consistency Check**
        The largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\max}$ is estimated as:

        $$
        \lambda_{\max} = \frac{1}{\lambda_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} \lambda_j
        $$

        The **Consistency Index (CI)** is given by:

        $$
        CI = \frac{\lambda_{\max} - n}{n-1}
        $$

        The **Consistency Ratio (CR)** is then computed using a **Random Index (RI)**:

        $$
        CR = \frac{CI}{RI}
        $$

        A **CR value ‚â§ 0.1** indicates an acceptable consistency level.

        ## **Summary**
        - The pairwise comparison matrix is built using **quantitative ranking** instead of expert judgment.
        - The eigenvector of the matrix determines the relative ranking of genes.
        - The eigenvalue and consistency ratio ensure that the matrix is valid for decision-making.

        This method ensures an **objective** and **stable** way to rank genes, which improves classification accuracy in cancer detection using **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**.

    The AHP consistency evaluation demonstrated excellent performance across all assessed metrics. As shown in the results, the Consistency Index (CI) values for t_test, entropy, roc_auc, and snr metrics were extremely close to zero, indicating that the pairwise comparisons were highly consistent. Correspondingly, the Consistency Ratio (CR) values were orders of magnitude lower than the acceptable threshold of 0.1, confirming a very high level of consistency in the constructed AHP matrices.

                        **U-shaped curve:** AHP scores are higher for genes with ROC AUC close to 0 or 1, and lower near 0.5.

                        **Biological meaning:** Genes that strongly distinguish cancer subtypes (either positively or negatively) are prioritized. This includes both upregulated and downregulated biomarkers, suggesting AHP is sensitive to directional changes in gene activity relevant to breast cancer.

                        **Clear positive trend:** As SNR increases, so do AHP scores.

                        **Biological meaning:** Genes with strong expression differences and low intra-class variability are ranked higher. These are likely stable and robust breast cancer biomarkers, capable of separating cancerous vs. non-cancerous or different subtypes (e.g., HER2+ vs. triple-negative

                        ### <span style'"color: green"> t-test Statistic vs AHP Scores </span>

                        **Strong linear correlation:** Higher t-values lead to higher AHP scores.

                        **Biological meaning:** AHP emphasizes genes that show statistically significant differential expression between groups. This supports the discovery of potential diagnostic or prognostic genes involved in tumor behavior, estrogen receptor signaling, or aggressiveness.

                        ### <span style'"color: green">  Wilcoxon Statistic and Wilcoxon p values vs AHP Scores </span>

                        **Positive correlation**, especially at higher Wilcoxon values.

                        **Biological meaning:** Even in non-parametric comparisons, AHP is sensitive to expression shifts. This indicates robustness to outliers and validates genes that may not follow normal distribution, which is common in real patient gene expression profiles.

                        **Low p-values (~0) align with high AHP scores**, but score distribution shows banding patterns.

                        **Biological meaning:** Genes with statistically significant differences in expression across conditions (e.g., cancer subtypes or stages) are appropriately prioritized. The banding may reflect discrete thresholds or tied rankings from AHP, often seen when many genes have similar significance

In multimodal deep learning, especially when integrating different types of data such as gene expression (numeric, high-dimensional) and clinical variables (tabular, categorical), five main fusion strategies are commonly used. As part of our exploratory analysis, we experimented with late fusion, where the outputs of individual models are combined at a later stage to make the final prediction. However, based on our findings, we ultimately decided to pursue a different approach for the final model.

        The performance of our initial exploratory model reveals a significant imbalance in classification capabilities across cancer stages. While metrics like accuracy (0.73) and specificity (0.97) appear strong, the sensitivity (0.63) highlights a crucial limitation ‚Äî the model struggles to correctly identify positive cancer cases.

        This sensitivity drop is a common symptom of class imbalance, where underrepresented stages skew the model's learning process. Such imbalanced distributions lead the model to favor majority classes, sacrificing its ability to detect minority class patterns.Even this model has been trained and tuned with Keras Tuner Network Architecture Search, but it seams like the unballence data is heacily effecting the performance of the model.

        To address the performance drop caused by class imbalance‚Äîparticularly the reduced sensitivity for minority cancer stages‚Äîwe introduced two architectural innovations in our main model. First, we replaced traditional classifiers for clinical data with CatBoost, a gradient boosting framework optimized for tabular datasets. CatBoost natively handles categorical features and employs built-in class weighting, helping counteract bias toward majority classes and improving detection of underrepresented stages. Second, we adopted an intermediate fusion strategy to combine clinical and gene expression modalities. Clinical data is transformed into embeddings via CatBoost, while gene expression is processed through a dedicated MLP. Their intermediate representations are then merged and passed through a joint MLP for final prediction. This method preserves the strengths of each modality while enabling effective cross-modal learning, outperforming both early and late fusion strategies in flexibility and synergy.

        The MLPs are trained and tuned utilizing Network Architecture search.

        ## Vanilla Neural Network (VNN): Laying the Groundwork

        For our **GeneScope** project, we started with a **Vanilla Neural Network** because we wanted to build a solid foundation before diving into a more complex Deep Neural Network. It was kind of like testing the waters ‚Äî VNNs are simple, fast to train, and great for giving us an early look at how our data behaves.

        Since our dataset includes well-processed gene expression and clinical features, a VNN was actually perfect for spotting meaningful patterns without all the added complexity. We also used PCA beforehand, which made the data even more streamlined and ready for a basic neural network to pick up on key signals.

        Of course, our final model is a deeper network because it can capture much more intricate relationships ‚Äî but starting with a VNN gave us a clean, reliable baseline to compare against. It helped us understand our data better, debug more effectively, and really appreciate the performance boost that depth brings. So even though the VNN isn‚Äôt the final star of the show, it played a huge role in shaping how we approached and improved our final model ‚Äî and we‚Äôre glad we included it!

        ![Vanilla vs Deep Network](Vanilla_Deep.png)

        ---

        ### How a Vanilla Neural Network Works

        At its core, a VNN is made up of layers of neurons that compute:

        $$
        \mathbf{a}^{(l)} = f\left( \mathbf{W}^{(l)} \cdot \mathbf{a}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)} \right)
        $$

        Where:

        - \( \mathbf{a}^{(l)} \): activation output of the \( l^\text{th} \) layer  
        - \( \mathbf{W}^{(l)} \): weight matrix connecting layer \( l-1 \) to layer \( l \)  
        - \( \mathbf{b}^{(l)} \): bias vector at layer \( l \)  
        - \( f \): activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)  
        - \( \mathbf{a}^{(0)} \): input layer (PCA-reduced gene expression + clinical features)

        ---

        ### ReLU Activation Function

        If you're using ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):

        $$
        f(x) = \max(0, x)
        $$

        This means the neuron outputs the value if it‚Äôs positive ‚Äî otherwise, it gives zero. ReLU is efficient, introduces non-linearity without complications, and helps avoid the vanishing gradient problem. It's fast, clean, and gets the job done ‚Äî perfect for training.

        ---

        ### Training the Network with Backpropagation

        During training, the model minimizes a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) using backpropagation:

        $$
        \theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}
        $$

        Where:

        - \( \theta \): model parameters (weights and biases)  
        - \( \eta \): learning rate  
        - \( \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L} \): gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters

        ---

        These equations form the backbone of how a VNN learns and makes predictions. While simple in form, they enable the model to learn complex relationships between features ‚Äî in our case, between clinical and gene expression data and the stages of breast cancer.

        This simplicity is exactly why we chose a VNN as our starting point: it helps build intuition, provides a performance benchmark, and guides the development of more complex models. By mastering this foundation, we can better appreciate the performance gains from our final deep architecture in GeneScope.

        Looking at the confusion matrix, we can see that the model performs exceptionally well on the early stages of breast cancer, like Stage I, IA, IB, and II, with a very high number of correct predictions. For instance, Stage IB and Stage II have nearly perfect classification, with 66 and 62 samples correctly predicted, respectively. This aligns with what we‚Äôd expect: early-stage cases often have clearer gene expression patterns, making them easier for the model to learn and classify. Despite this, it‚Äôs impressive how well the model handles advanced stages like IIIC, IV, and X ‚Äî predicting them correctly with minimal confusion. Stage IV, which is clinically very significant, was perfectly predicted in 53 out of 53 cases, which is a huge win for our early baseline model.

        Now to better understand the performance of our Deep Neural Network, we also included **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** as a comparison model ‚Äî and honestly, it was a super insightful choice. KNN is a classic, straightforward algorithm that doesn‚Äôt do any ‚Äúlearning‚Äù during the training phase. Instead, it stores all the training data and makes predictions based on the most similar neighbors when given a new sample.

        Under the hood, it all comes down to **distance** ‚Äî usually **Euclidean distance** ‚Äî between data points in the feature space. When a new sample comes in, KNN looks for the \( k \) closest points (neighbors) in the training set and uses them to make a prediction.

        To measure how ‚Äúclose‚Äù a point is, we use:

        $$
        d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i) = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{n} \left( x_j - x_{ij} \right)^2 }
        $$

        Where:

        - \( \mathbf{x} \) is the new input vector (the sample to predict)  
        - \( \mathbf{x}_i \) is a point in the training set  
        - \( x_j \) and \( x_{ij} \) are the \( j^\text{th} \) features of those vectors  
        - \( d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i) \) is the distance between the two vectors

        After calculating the distances to all training samples, KNN:

        1. Sorts the training samples by their distance to the new point  
        2. Selects the \( k \) closest ones  
        3. Assigns a label based on majority vote (for classification) or takes the average (for regression)

        ---

        ### Why Use KNN?

        We used KNN because it gives us a **very different baseline**. While Deep Neural Networks aim to learn complex, abstract representations of the data, KNN is all about **local similarity**. It relies entirely on the distances between points in feature space, which makes it extremely useful for understanding how well our **PCA-reduced features** cluster and whether cancer stages are naturally separable.

        However, KNN comes with tradeoffs:

        - It doesn‚Äôt scale well with large datasets  
        - It performs poorly in high-dimensional spaces (like gene expression data)  
        - It is sensitive to irrelevant features and noise  

        This is why preprocessing ‚Äî especially **dimensionality reduction with PCA** ‚Äî is crucial when using KNN for tasks like ours.

        Despite its simplicity, KNN gave us useful insights into how our data behaves in lower-dimensional space and served as a solid baseline to compare against more advanced models in the GeneScope project.

        Looking at all four visualizations side by side ‚Äî the confusion matrix, and the precision, recall, and F1-score bar charts it‚Äôs clear that our KNN model does a pretty solid job overall, but it also exposes some interesting patterns. The model performs exceptionally well on stages like IB, II, IIIC, IV, and X, consistently showing high precision, recall, and F1-scores. These are the stages where KNN absolutely shines, likely because the features for those classes are well-separated in PCA space, making them easy for the model to identify. But when we turn our attention to Stages IIA, IIB, and IIIA, we start seeing some trouble. These classes have lower scores across the board and show up scattered in the confusion matrix a clear sign that KNN is struggling to tell them apart. That makes sense, too: since KNN relies on distances, overlapping or similar feature distributions in these mid-stage classes can easily throw it off. Still, that‚Äôs exactly why this visualization is so valuable it helps us pinpoint where the model is confident and where it gets confused, giving us a roadmap for improvement as we move toward more complex architectures. It's exciting to see how much we can learn just from the shapes and colors of these plots!
