1. Synthetic Data Generation (Clinical + Gene Data)
Generate synthetic data points that mimic the characteristics of your original dataset.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing data points.

Works well with gene expression profiles and clinical features.

Python: imbalanced-learn library (e.g., SMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE).

ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling): Similar to SMOTE but focuses on hard-to-learn samples.

Can help with rare cancer subtypes or patients with unique clinical profiles.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Deep learning-based technique that can generate new samples by learning a lower-dimensional representation.

Effective when combining gene expression profiles and clinical variables.

Python: TensorFlow, PyTorch.

2. Data Augmentation by Combining Clinical Variables
Clinical variables can provide meaningful information to create synthetic samples that are more biologically realistic.

Feature Transformation:

Slightly perturb numerical features (e.g., age, weight, diagnosis age) using a small random noise.

Generate new samples by recombining different clinical variables with gene profiles.

Example: Swap age_at_diagnosis or race between patients and associate them with gene expression profiles.

Generating Synthetic Patients:

Group patients based on clinical variables (e.g., paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50, primary_diagnosis).

Within each group, generate synthetic gene expression profiles using SMOTE or VAEs.

Combine these with clinical variables to create augmented samples.

3. Ensemble Methods (Instead of Augmentation)
Use ensemble techniques to train multiple models on the minority class and combine predictions.

Bagging / Boosting: Especially useful with decision trees and random forests.

Weighted Loss Functions: Penalize the model more for misclassifying the minority class (works well with Neural Networks).

4. Clinical Variable-Based Augmentation
Using clinical variables alone can also generate meaningful augmentations:

Create synthetic profiles by mixing values from different patients.

Bootstrap Sampling: Randomly sample clinical features with replacement and combine them with gene expression data.
